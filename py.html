    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
    language with dynamic semantics.  Its high-level built in data
    structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
    very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use
    as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
    together.  Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
    readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
    Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
    modularity and code reuse.  The Python interpreter and the extensive
    standard library are available in source or binary form without charge
    for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
    
    </p><p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the
    increased productivity it provides.  Since there is no compilation
    step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python
    programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation
    fault.  Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an
    exception.  When the program doesn't catch the exception, the
    interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows
    inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary
    expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at
    a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
    testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often
    the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements
    to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple
    approach very effective.
