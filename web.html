        <h1 class="my-auto text-center">Web Development</h1>
        <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building,
            and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include
            web design, web programming, and database management.</p>
        <p>
            The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
            Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used
            to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by
            writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress,
            Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.

                <p><br>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of
                    websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved
                    for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.</p>
                <p>Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making
                    sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web
                    Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary
                    depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.</p>

            id="what-are-the-types-of-web-development?">
            <h2 class="bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element">Types of Web Development</h2>
        </div>
        <p>There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack
            development.</p>
        <h3 class="bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element">What Is Back-End Development?</h3>
        <div class="bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1">
            <p>If Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-End Developers are focused
                on how it works. A Back-End Developer creates the basic framework of a website before maintaining it and
                ensuring it performs the way it should, including database interactions, user authentication, server,
                network and hosting configuration, and business logic. Working behind the scenes – or server-side – Back
                End Developers are concerned with the systems and structures that allow computer applications to perform
                as desired.</p>
            <p>The primary responsibility of Back-End Developers is to ensure the functionality of the site, including
                its responsiveness and speed. To do that, Back-End Developers have to know how to build servers with
                modern frameworks (while developing custom APIs and serving static websites and files), and how to
                manage databases and data on a web server.</p>
            <p>Typically, Back-End Developers use server-side programming languages, including PHP, Ruby, and Python, as
                well as tools including MySQL, Oracle, and Git.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element">What Is Front-End Development?</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1">
                <p>Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say usually,
                    front-end web development refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will
                    see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital
                    product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.</p>
                <p>Front-End Web Developers focus on translating website design and visual ideas into code. A front-end
                    Software Developer takes the design ideas created by others on web development teams and programs
                    them into reality, acting as a bridge between design and technology.</p>
                <p>Front-End Developers will usually need to possess a solid understanding of programming languages,
                    including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone,
                    AngularJS, and EmberJS. Responsibilities of a Front-End Developer would include creating responsive
                    websites (that look and function well on any device), conducting website testing and fixing any bugs
                    detected along the web development process, and ensuring site structure follows SEO best practices.

        <h2 class="bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element">What Is a Full-Stack Developer?</h2>
        <div class="wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1">
                    <p>A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. Full Stack
                        Developers usually understand a wide variety of programming languages and because of their
                        versatility, they might be given more of a leadership role on projects than developers who
                        specialize. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of
                        development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers – according to an Indeed
                        study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.</p>
                    <p>If the title is contentious, it’s in the generalist nature of the position. Developers who
                        specialize in the front-end or back-end often bristle at the notion that someone could be
                        equally adept at both – the expression “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” comes to mind.</p>
                    <p>“My defensive tendencies are normally put on high alert when I hear that magic phrase
                        (‘full-stack’),” wrote Front-End Developer Andy Shora. “Stacks are a lot bigger than what they
                        used to be, and being able to claim one has acquired refined skills at every layer of web
                        development is certainly not a small claim. Does this mean you have a broad range of skills or
                        you specialize in everything?”</p>
                    <p>While that perception persists, there still is an increasing number of tech professionals who
                        consider themselves Full-Stack Developers. According to a recent Stack Overflow survey of
                        Developers, 48.2 percent consider themselves Full-Stack Developers.</p>
                    <p>What’s unclear is whether Developers are now expected to possess a broader skillset, or if
                        Developers are taking it upon themselves to understand functions at both the front-end and
                        back-end. Either way, it’s becoming increasingly important for aspiring Developers to have a
                        foundation in both.</p>
                    <p>“For most people hoping to break into web improvement, you should center around working up an
                        establishment in both front-end and back-end advancement first,” recommended Software Engineer
                        and Tech Writer Muhammad Anser. “At that point, you can float towards a claim to fame later on.”
                    </p>
                    <p>And with demand for Developers expected to grow 15 percent by 2026 (for 24,400 new jobs), much
                        faster than the U.S. average rate of job growth, there may not be a better time to dive in and
                        learn more about all the layers of Web Development.</p>
